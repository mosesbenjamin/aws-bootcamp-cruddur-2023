## Required Homework

#### Install and Verify AWS CLI

I was not able to use Gitpod or Github Codespaces due to browser issues
I used a local environment

In order to prove that I am able to use AWS CLI.
I am providing the instructions I used for configuring my local machine on an apple m1 mac

I did the following steps to install AWS CLI

I installed AWS CLI via **zsh**

I followed instructions on the [AWS CLI Documentation Page](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)

```
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/AWSCLIV2.pkg" -o "AWSCLIV2.pkg"
sudo installer -pkg AWSCLIV2.pkg -target /
